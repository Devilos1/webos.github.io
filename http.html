<h3>HTTP Protocol Explanation</h3>

<div id=farm>

<p class=p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and allows for communication between web browsers and servers.<br><br>

<p class=p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a user enters a URL into their web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server where the requested webpage is located. The server then responds with the requested webpage and any associated resources, such as images or videos, in the form of an HTTP response.<br><br>
</p>
<p class=p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP requests can be of several types, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, each with their own specific purpose. GET requests are used to retrieve a specific resource, while POST requests are used to submit data to the server. PUT requests are used to update a specific resource, and DELETE requests are used to delete a specific resource.<br><br>
</p>
<p class=p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP uses a client-server architecture, where the web browser acts as the client and the server hosting the webpage acts as the server. The client sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server sends an HTTP response in return.
</p>
<p class=p>
&nbsp;One important aspect of HTTP is that it is a stateless protocol, which means that each request is independent and does not retain any information about previous requests.<br>To maintain a persistent connection between the client and the server, cookies and sessions are often used.<br><br>
