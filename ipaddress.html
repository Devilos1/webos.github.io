IP address stands for internet protocol address; it is an identifying number that is associated with a specific computer or computer network. When connected to the internet, the IP address allows the computers to send and receive information.

<br>
An IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods. IP addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers — an example address might be 192.158.1.38. Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

<li>An IP address allows information to be sent and received by the correct parties, which means it can also be used to track down a user's physical location in some instances.

<center><b><h2><font color=purple>How an IP Address Works</font></h2></b></center>
<br>
An IP address allows computers
 to send and receive data over the internet.
  Most IP addresses are purely numerical,
   but as internet usage grows, letters have been
    added to some addresses.
<br>
There are four different types of IP addresses: public, private, static, and dynamic. While the public and private are indicative of the location of the network—private being used inside a network while the public is used outside of a network—static and dynamic indicate permanency.
<br>
static IP address is one that was manually created, as opposed to having been assigned. A static address also does not change, whereas a dynamic IP address has been assigned by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server and is subject to change.<br>
 Dynamic IP addresses are the most common type of internet protocol addresses. Dynamic IP addresses are only active for a certain amount of time, after which they expire. The computer will either automatically request a new lease, or the computer may receive a new IP address.
