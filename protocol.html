      <li>HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
      <li>a protocol used to access the data on the World Wide Web (www).
      <li>The HTTP protocol can be used to transfer the data in the form of plain text, hypertext, audio, video, and so on

      <li>HTTP is used to carry the data in the form of MIME-like format.
      <li>HTTP is similar to SMTP as the data is transferred between client and server. The HTTP differs from the SMTP in the way the messages are sent from the client to the server and from server to the client. SMTP messages are stored and forwarded while HTTP messages are delivered immediately.
