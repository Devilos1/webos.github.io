Uniform Resource Locators were defined in RFC 
1738 in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor
 of the World Wide Web, and the URI working
  group of the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF), as an outcome of collaboration started
    at the IETF Living Documents birds of a feather
     session in 1992.

     <center><b><h3>Why is URL tag used in HTML?</h3></b></center>
     The <link> tag is most often used to 
     link to external style sheets or to add a 
     favicon to your website.

     <center><b><h3>Why is URL so important?</h3></b></center>
     
     URLs are important for two
      main reasons: firstly, because
       they help us organise and find
        things on the internet; secondly,
         because they define the URL structure 
         of a website.
